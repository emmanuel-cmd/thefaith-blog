      <description>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me (Psalms 23:4). Are you passing through difficult times? Do you feel like giving up? Do you strongly regret your past decisions and actions? Do you feel hopeless and discouraged? However you feel as you read this post, God&amp;rsquo;s Word to you is that &amp;ldquo;I am with you&amp;rdquo;.</description>
