      <description>Thank God! It is possible to live a life of dominion, constant victory, and triumph. It is possible that you are always happy and never depressed. It is possible that you never fall sick and never have to visit the doctor. You may be so healthy that you never have to take drugs with negative side effects. You may be at constant peace with your family and children that you never have to worry about them.</description>

      <description>** in progress **
As believers, we are blessed with every spiritual blessing prepared for us in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. We have exceeding great and precious promises set to our credit in the Word. Jesus Christ came and died for us to redeem us from the curse of the law and to bring us into spiritual blessings (I Cor 1:3). We have an inheritance to enjoy all-round prosperity. But how can we lay hold on these blessings so that we may experience them in our lives?</description>
