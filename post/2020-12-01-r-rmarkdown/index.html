<p>It is possible to live a life of dominion, constant victory, and triumph. It is possible that you are always happy and never depressed. It is possible that you never fall sick and never have to visit the doctor. You may be so healthy that you never have to take drugs with negative side effects. You may be at constant peace with your family and children that you never have to worry about them. You may live in prosperity that you don’t have to struggle or work long hours to provide for yourself and family. You can have your dream job and that will bring you much more satisfaction. You can have all your heart’s desire – good relationships, love, success, strength, joy, riches, health and so on. No matter how sweet and wonderful your life may seem now, things can be better and even more sweet and wonderful. A life of peace, victory and joy awaits you in Christ.</p>
<p>Christ died and resurrected to provide us with all the good things of life and all He did was for our sake. <em>“… that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life”</em> <span class="hovertext" data-hover="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">(John 3:16)</span>. Through the acceptance of Christ, we live a life of dominion, constant victory, and triumph <span class="hovertext" data-hover="4. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 5. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?">(I John 5:4-5)</span>. In the beginning, Adam our forefather sinned against God by disobeying His instruction. Adam was living a life of dominion but after he sinned and didn’t repent for his sins, his life was changed to death which is the consequence of the sin he committed. Jesus Christ died and satisfied the claims of justice to restore this life back to us and that we may have it abundantly, even as Adam had it before he sinned <a href="">(John 10:10)</a>.</p>
<p>Christ suffered, died, and was resurrected for our sake. After His resurrection, He appeared to His disciples in power. That power through which God raised Christ from the dead is available to us today and it is through this power that we live a superior life <a href="">(Ephesians 1:20)</a>. The Scripture in <a href="">Romans 8:11</a> says that the Spirit of God at work in us heals us of all diseases. Through the Spirit of God in us, we also have access to a higher type of wisdom and creativity that is unique and extraordinary <a href="">(Job 28:12-17)</a>. As believers, we are healthy, confident, and bold <a href="">(Ephesians 3:12)</a>. We have a very smart mind that can comprehend the most difficult things quickly. The Spirit of God at work in us through Jesus Christ makes us of a quick understanding <a href="">(Job 32:8)</a>. This is the same wisdom and creativity at work in Adam before he sinned and the Bible records that he single-handedly named all plants and animals that was created by God <a href="">(Genesis 2:18-20)</a>.</p>
<p><em>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God… by Him all things were made and without Him was nothing made that was made … In Him was life and the life was the light of men.</em> This Scripture says that Christ was there in the beginning during the creation of the world. Before the foundation of the world, Jesus the Lamb of God had been slain and had resurrected as the Messiah. With the resurrection power at work in Him, He was able to raise Lazarus from the dead despite being dead four days. Jesus couldn’t have raised him and others if He doesn’t have resurrection power. Christ’s resurrection was necessary for our salvation from the consequences of Adam’s sin and for the transfer of His power to us through the Holy Spirit. This power makes us free of sickness, depression, poverty, worry, or fear because these things could not be found in Christ (<a href="">Mathew 28:18-20</a>; <a href="">Acts 1:8</a>). Believers are <em>more than conquerors in Christ who strengthens us &hellip;</em> It is time to join the family of believers today so that you too can partake of this new life in Christ. Please say this prayer: <strong>“Lord Jesus, I surrender my life to you today and accept you as my Lord and Saviour. I believe you died and resurrected so that it may be well with me. I now join the family of believers, and I begin a new life of dominion. Jesus, come into my life and fill me with your Holy Spirit”</strong>.</p>
<p>WELCOME TO THE FAMILY!</p>
