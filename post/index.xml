It is possible that you never fall sick and never have to visit the doctor. You may be so healthy that you never have to take drugs with negative side effects. You may be at constant peace with your family and children that you never have to worry about them.</description>

      <description>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me (Psalms 23:4). Are you passing through difficult times? Do you feel like giving up? Do you strongly regret your past decisions and actions? Do you feel hopeless and discouraged? However you feel as you read this post, God&amp;rsquo;s Word to you is that &amp;ldquo;I am with you&amp;rdquo;.</description>
