      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i>Abraham&rsquo;s blessings are mine, Abraham&rsquo;s blessings are mine. I am blessed in the morning, I am blessed in the evening. Abraham&rsquo;s blessings are mine<i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i></p>
<p>As believers, we are blessed with every spiritual blessings prepared for us in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. We have exceeding great and precious promises set to our credit and documented in the Word. Jesus Christ came and died for us to redeem us from the curse of the law and to bring us into spiritual blessings <a href="">I Corinthians 1:3</a>. We have an inheritance to enjoy all-round prosperity. But how can we be a living manifestation of these blessings? Like an iron naturally attracts/is attracted to a magnet. To sustain and effectively manifest the blessings of Yahweh, some habits must be in place the life of a believer.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness: the baptism or indwelling of the Holy Spirit: The baptism of the Holy Spirit is a necessity after the acceptance of Christ as Lord and Saviour. It guarantees the maintenance of Christ’s nature which was passed to the believer at salvation. The infilling of the Holy Spirit replaces spiritual death with life. The Holy Spirit is the same spirit at work in Christ. So, the Holy Spirit is the spirit of Christ. And <em>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law … that the blessings of Abraham might come upon the gentiles through Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith</em>. Christ is a carrier of the blessings of Abraham. Therefore, a baptism into His Spirit activates the blessings of Abraham in our lives. In other words, the incoming of His Spirit is accompanied by every spiritual blessing and a notable one among them is the blessing of Abraham.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fasting &amp; Prayer: Fasting helps the Spirit to be stronger than the flesh. It guarantees a strong connection to the throne of heaven while praying. Because the Spirit is dominant, the will of God is easily performed. The Spirit brings to your remembrance the Word of God that you should use in making your demands or standing your ground in prayer. The Spirit also helps your infirmities, as you do not know how to pray or what you should ask for. The Spirit helps you to maintain your connection to heaven and to ask according to the will of God. A diligent performance of this spiritual activity guarantees the manifestation of blessings in the life of the believer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fellowship: But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions <a href="">Obadiah 1:17</a>. Zion is the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven <a href="">Hebrews 12:22-23</a>. Zion in basically is the church or a gathering of believers for service. In Zion, your spiritual engine gets &lsquo;serviced&rsquo; and you return refreshed and replenished. A commitment to Zion guarantees the sustained manifestation of God&rsquo;s blessings in the life of the believer <a href="">Psalms 133:3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise: Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us <a href="">Psalms 67:5-6</a>. As your praises go up, then God&rsquo;s blessings come down. A life of praise is a blessed life. The more you praise God, the more blessed you are. Praise Him for the things you haven&rsquo;t received yet but that you are praying for. Praise God because only Him deserves to receive your praise and thanksgiving. You have no reason to complain but to praise! The ability to praise God is what distinguishes the living from the dead. You are alive because you have been given the opportunity to continue praising God. HALLELUYAH!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Give attention to the Word: The Word of God is the source of God's blessing (They which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham(Gal 3:9))</p>
</li>
