      <p>** in progress **</p>
<p>As believers, we are blessed with every spiritual blessing prepared for us in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. We have exceeding great and precious promises set to our credit in the Word. Jesus Christ came and died for us to redeem us from the curse of the law and to bring us into spiritual blessings (I Cor 1:3). We have an inheritance to enjoy all-round prosperity. But how can we lay hold on these blessings so that we may experience them in our lives? The following are strategies to activate the blessings and promises planned for believers in the Word:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Seek the baptism of the Holy Spirit: The baptism of the Holy Spirit is a necessity after the acceptance of Christ as Lord and Saviour. It guarantees the maintenance of Christ’s nature which was passed to the believer at salvation. The infilling of the Holy Spirit replaces spiritual death with life. The Holy Spirit is the same spirit at work in Christ. So, the Holy Spirit is the spirit of Christ. And Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law … that the blessings of Abraham might come upon the gentiles through Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. Christ is a carrier of the blessings of Abraham. A baptism into His Spirit activates the blessings of Abraham. In other words, the incoming of the Spirit is accompanied by every spiritual blessing and a notable one among them is the blessing of Abraham.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fasting &amp; Prayer: Fasting helps the Spirit to be stronger than the flesh. It guarantees a strong connection to the throne of heaven while praying. Because the Spirit is dominant, the will of God is easily performed. The Spirit brings to your remembrance the Word of God that you should use in making your demands or standing your ground in prayer. The Spirit also helps your infirmities, as you do not know how to pray or what you should ask for. The Spirit helps you to maintain your connection to heaven and to ask according to the will of God. A diligent performance of this spiritual activity guarantees the manifestations of blessings in the life of the believer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fellowship: On mount Zion, there shall be deliverance, there shall be holiness and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise: As your praises go up, then His blessings come down. A life of praise is a blessed life. The more you praise Him, the more blessed you are. Let all the praise thee, then shall the earth yield her increase. Then our God</p>
</li>
</ol>
