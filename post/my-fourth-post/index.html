<p><em>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me</em> (<a href="">Psalms 23:4</a>). Are you passing through difficult times? Do you feel like giving up? Do you strongly regret your past decisions and actions? Do you feel hopeless and discouraged? However you feel as you read this post, God&rsquo;s Word to you is that &ldquo;I am with you&rdquo;. You are not alone in this matter, He is with you (<a href="">Matthew 28:20</a>). And because He is with you, you are sure to come out of that negative situation in victory.</p>
<p><em>Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore</em> (<a href="">Psalms 16:11</a>). Now that you know that He is with you, the next step is to be joyful and to begin to give Him praise. You see, only the living can do that. And since you&rsquo;re alive and He is with you, you&rsquo;ve got bright days ahead (<a href="">Ecclesiastes 9:4-12</a>). Not only that, that situation will turn out for good - exactly the way you what you want it, because that scriptures says <em>at His right hand are pleasures forevermore</em>.</p>
<p><em>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, And the young men shall utterly fall, But those who wait on the LORD shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint</em> (<a href="">Isaiah 40:31</a>). Now is the time of waiting. It is the time to look forward to divine intervention. And God is never late, he is sure to deliver at the right time. Your anxiety will only weaken the strength he has given to you to wait effectively upon Him. Replace that anxiety with prayer and confidence (<a href="">Phillipians 4:7</a>).</p>
<p>Here are some things you must do while you wait on Him.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Resist the devil: The devil is as a roaring lion walking to and fro, seeking whom he may devour. The devil is lurking about and destroying people&rsquo;s lives. He wants your situation to become worse off so he tempts you at this time like never before. He knows fully well that when you give in, the presence of God departs from you and you become helpless. Don&rsquo;t give in! Resist him and he will flee! Continually cover yourself with the blood of Jesus and he will not be found around you. Your victory is sure but you must not give in to the devil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rejoice: Let your confession be: <em>Even though the fig trees have no blossoms, and there are no grapes on the vines; even though the olive crop fails, and the fields lie empty and barren; even though the flocks die in the fields, and the cattle barns are empty, yet I will rejoice in the LORD!</em> (<a href="">Habakkuk 3:17-19</a>). This is the time to play your favorite Christian music. This is the time to wear your dancing shoes and give Him a dance! Dance till you drive the devil crazy! Yes, when you praise Him, He blesses you! <em>“Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him”</em> (<a href="">Psalms 67:5-7</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make only positive confessions: <em>..As I live, saith the Lord: surely as ye spoke into my ears, so will I do to you (<a href="">Numbers 14:28</a>)</em>. Now is not the time for negative confessions or regrets. Make only positive confessions and that will hasten the manifestation of your expectation. Speak positive creative words into that situation and it will change for the better. Begin to confess your desires and you will have what you say. Say <em>I&rsquo;m victorious, strong, healthy, beautiful, fruitful, successful &hellip;</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the Lord&rsquo;s great love, we are not consumed for his compassion never fails, they are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.</p>
